        - Pain Preparation: Though the sensation of micro pigment implantation
        is minimal, clients respond differently. Some will feel a stronger
        sensation than others. Overall, procedures require minimal pain
        preparation. However, some client’s have taken over-the-counter Tylenol,
        thirty (30) minutes before treatment. This will not interfere with the
        procedure. Any physician prescribed pain-relieving medication for which
        you have arranged, should be taken as directed, and usually after your
        arrival or 30-minutes before treatment. Please advise me of any
        medications taken. Clients having eyeliner done should not plan to drive
        home, or for the remainder of the day after the treatment.

          The “after care” procedures are as important to the retention of the
          pigment as the actual implantation process.
        </b>
        During this period, the primary objective is to allow the bonding
        process to be completely sealed inside the dermis. Your compliance will
        ensure that you receive maximum benefits from the procedure and reduce
        inconvenient follow-up visits.

          ‍Judgment of your results should be deferred until three to four weeks
          following the final procedure.
        </b>
        Please remember, immediately following the procedure, your eyeliner can
        look harsh and painted on. It will soften up and look a lot more natural
        as it heals…please be patient! The intensity of the procedure is most
        prominent following the procedure itself. Over the next 3-7 days, the
        outer layer of color will appear crusty and start to flake off. Special
        care should be exercised while the treated area is healing. Under no
        circumstances should you pick, scratch or rub the treated area or
        attempt to remove the crusty material. Removing of the crusts may result
        in the removal of the actual pigment and/or infection may occur. It is
        important that this protective “cover” stay on during the healing
        process (three to seven days). As the outer layer flakes off, you will
        notice that the color is lighter and softer, and the treatment may
        appear to be slightly thinner than the original day of your procedure.
        For the following two weeks, color that was implanted under the skin
        will move forward. After three weeks, your healing process should be
        complete.

        - If you wear contact lenses, do not replace them for the remainder of
        the day. For the best results, contact lenses should not be worn for two
        or three days.

        - After you leave, ice packs can be applied for 10 to 15 minutes each
        hour for the first 4-8 hours following the procedure. The ice is used to
        reduce swelling and provide comfort. If you experience any residual
        swelling the following day, you may ice them again. After the first 24
        hours the use of ice is no longer beneficial. • No soap, cleanser or
        shampoo on the treated area for seven (7) days. Soap and cleansers are
        designed to remove any foreign substances. Obviously, this is
        detrimental to the bonding process required for the pigment to become
        permanent.

        - All cleansing should be done with a clean Q-tip dipped in cool water

        - Apply a tattoo after care cream (I will send you home with some), if
        you are not allergic to it, with a Q-Tip in the procedure area for the
        first 24 hours at least 2-3 times. Then for the rest of the week apply
        twice a day, again with a Q-tip. Please do not use fingers as they may
        have bacteria on them. Do not use mineral oil or petroleum based
        products such as Vaseline. Use the Q-tip in a gentle dabbing motion as
        not to disrupt the pigmentation bonding process. This will keep the area
        moist and accelerate the healing.

        - Baths and showers are permitted, but do not wash, scrub, or touch the

        - For at least two (2) weeks, you need to minimize exposure to the sun.
        I strongly discourage swimming in fresh, salt or chlorinated pool water,

        healing.

        - Do not use any cosmetics on or near the treated area for seven (7)
        days. The permanent procedure, even after the first treatment, looks so
        natural that you can feel very secure appearing in public without any
        additional makeup on the affected area. This rule applies also to
        non-allergic makeup, as it may contain chemicals that interfere with the
        bonding process. When you do begin to wear mascara again, using a new
        tube is important, as this will reduce contamination of bacteria.If
        needed, over-the-counter Tylenol is recommended for temporary relief of
        pain.

        pick, scratch or rub the treated area or attempt to remove the crusty

        have any questions after you get home, feel free to call. Always use
        good health habits.Variations to these recommendations are not
        encouraged and will most likely affect the final out come of your

        after the initial procedure to have this done, as there could be an
