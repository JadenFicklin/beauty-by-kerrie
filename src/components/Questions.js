      <div className="sub-heading">
        I have several colors to choose from. If you have a favorite color bring
        it in and I can match it.

      <div className="heading">Does the procedure hurt?</div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        There are several topical anesthetics if you need one, I use great
        numbing creams. I numb you for 15 minutes before I start. I also have
        discovered a numbing technique that works really well. If you are on
        your period, you may be more sensitive. Caffeine and sugar will
        stimulate the nerves so it should be avoided the day before and the day
        of the procedure. If you have a hard time numbing at the dentist office,
        it is recommended to take 10mg of valium and or 10mg of percocet. Ask
        your doctor for a prescription.

      <div className="heading">How long does the procedure take?</div>

      <div className="heading">How long does permanent make up last?</div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        The permanent makeup that I do lasts 5-10 years. I use high quality
        pigments and/or inks that add to the longevity. I use the rotary pen
        method which goes deeper and lasts longer. I encourage my clients to get
        a color boost to darken their colors back up after 5-7 years.

        How many appointments are necessary for a procedure?
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        I highly recommend getting a 4-6 week touch up to ensure proper healing
        and to make any necessary adjustments. The initial touch up is usually
        enough, but occasionally (if you make big adjustments in your initial
        touch up) a third may be necessary.

        How long does it take for permanent eyeliner to heal?
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        A tightline application should generally heal within three to seven
        days, but a thicker eyeliner application may take seven to 10 days. You
        should definitely avoid touching or rubbing your eyes while they heal,
        so you don't spread any germs or bacteria around the area. I HIGHLY
        reccomend avoiding makeup on any new tattoo for at least 2 weeks. Full
        heal, when you will see your true healed color is about 4 weeks.

      <div className="heading">Is permanent make-up like a regular tattoo?</div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        No, it is similar to the same procedure but is not as deep as a regular
        tattoo so therefore it is not completely permanent. The equipment I use
        is made for fine detail work. It is recommended to do makeup that looks
        natural and enhances your natural beauty.
      </div>{" "}
      <br></br>
      <div className="heading">What if I don’t like the makeup anymore?</div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        I can lighten, darken, or change the color. You can also get it removed
        with a laser or saline (I am hoping to be trained in removal soon, but
        will need to refer you to someone else for removal if needed).

      <div className="heading">
        Will there be swelling after the procedures?
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">
        Some people swell and some don’t. If you do swell it only lasts for 3
        days. After your procedure you can take 800 mg of Ibuprofen. I recommend
        icing the area after your procedure for comfort and to reduce swelling.
